# Supervised-Learning-Models-From-Scratch
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to illustrate how some of the models used in supervised machine learning work. The implementations have been designed so as to facilitate understanding of the model and not in manner that prioritizes computational efficiency.

## Linear Regression and Regularization Techniques
Linear regression fits a model with coefficients w = (w0,w1,...,wn) to minimise the mean squared error cost function between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation. The linear model can be regularized with Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and Elastic Net to decrease variance.

## Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression fits a model with coefficients w = (w0,w1,...,wn) to minimise the mean squared error cost function between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation. Polynomial regression is a powerful model able
to detect complex non-linear relationships between features in the dataset.
